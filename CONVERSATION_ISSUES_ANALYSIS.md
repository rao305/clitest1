# Boiler AI Conversation Issues Analysis & Fixes

## Issues Identified from Conversation Examples

### 1. **Course Number Confusion**
- **Problem**: System using old 3-digit course numbers instead of current 5-digit ones
- **Examples Found**:
  - Mentioned "CS 182" but should clarify sequence CS 18000 → CS 18200
  - Referenced "CS 240", "CS 241", "CS 251" instead of CS 24000, CS 25100, CS 25100
  - Mentioned "CS 320" and "CS 307" incorrectly

### 2. **Prerequisite Logic Errors**
- **Problem**: Incorrect prerequisite information being provided
- **Specific Issues**:
  - Claimed CS 180/182 are alternatives (they're sequential: CS 18000 → CS 18200)
  - Wrong prerequisite for CS 250 (should be CS 25000 requiring CS 18200 + CS 24000)
  - Incorrect hierarchy information

### 3. **Course Mapping Errors**
- **Problem**: Incorrect mapping from old to new course numbers
- **Specific Issues**:
  - CS 182 should map to CS 18200, not be treated as alternative to CS 18000
  - CS 241 should map to CS 25100 (Data Structures), not CS 24100
  - CS 320 should map to CS 35200 (Operating Systems), not CS 32000

## Knowledge Base Verification

Based on examination of `/data/cs_knowledge_graph.json` and degree progression guides:

### Correct Foundation Sequence:
```
CS 18000 (Problem Solving and OOP)
    ↓
CS 18200 (Foundations of CS) [requires CS 18000 + MA 16100]
    ↓
CS 24000 (Programming in C) [requires CS 18000]
    ↓
CS 25000 (Computer Architecture) [requires CS 18200 + CS 24000]
CS 25100 (Data Structures) [requires CS 18200 + CS 24000]
    ↓
CS 25200 (Systems Programming) [requires CS 25000 + CS 25100]
```

### Correct Course Mappings:
- CS 180 → CS 18000 (Problem Solving and Object-Oriented Programming)
- CS 182 → CS 18200 (Foundations of Computer Science)
- CS 240 → CS 24000 (Programming in C)
- CS 241 → CS 25100 (Data Structures and Algorithms)
- CS 250 → CS 25000 (Computer Architecture)
- CS 251 → CS 25100 (Data Structures and Algorithms)
- CS 252 → CS 25200 (Systems Programming)
- CS 307 → CS 30700 (Database Systems)
- CS 320 → CS 35200 (Operating Systems)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Course Normalization Fix** (`course_normalization_fix.py`)
- Created explicit mapping dictionary for problematic course numbers
- Fixed CS 182 → CS 18200 mapping (was incorrectly going to CS 18000)
- Fixed CS 241 → CS 25100 mapping (was incorrectly going to CS 24100)
- Fixed CS 320 → CS 35200 mapping (was incorrectly going to CS 32000)

### 2. **Prerequisite Information Fix**
- Corrected prerequisite chains based on knowledge base
- CS 18000: No CS prerequisites (starting point)
- CS 18200: Requires CS 18000 + MA 16100
- CS 24000: Requires CS 18000
- CS 25000: Requires CS 18200 + CS 24000
- CS 25100: Requires CS 18200 + CS 24000
- CS 25200: Requires CS 25000 + CS 25100

### 3. **Hierarchy Response Fix**
- Created accurate hierarchy response function
- Clarifies that CS 18000 and CS 18200 are sequential, not alternatives
- Explains correct prerequisite relationships
- Emphasizes critical path dependencies

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- **Course Normalization**: ✅ PASS
- **Prerequisite Logic**: ✅ PASS
- **Hierarchy Response**: ✅ PASS

## Conversation Examples - Before vs After

### Example 1: Course Hierarchy Question
**User**: "give me the hierarchy of cs classes"

**Before (Incorrect)**:
- Mixed up CS 180/182 as alternatives
- Mentioned CS 241 instead of CS 25100
- Incorrect prerequisite information

**After (Fixed)**:
- Clear sequence: CS 18000 → CS 18200 → CS 24000 → CS 25000/25100 → CS 25200
- Correct prerequisites for each course
- Clarification that CS 18000 and CS 18200 are sequential

### Example 2: Prerequisites Question
**User**: "If i want to take CS250 what prerequisites do i need"

**Before (Incorrect)**:
- Referenced CS 250 as CS 25000 incorrectly
- May have provided wrong prerequisites

**After (Fixed)**:
- CS 25000 (Computer Architecture) requires: CS 18200 + CS 24000
- Clear explanation of prerequisite chain

### Example 3: CS 182 Question
**User**: "i dont need to take cs180 to take cs182?"

**Before (Incorrect)**:
- Confused about relationship between CS 180 and CS 182

**After (Fixed)**:
- Clear explanation: CS 18000 → CS 18200 (sequential requirement)
- CS 18200 requires CS 18000 completion

## Integration Strategy

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. Update `intelligent_conversation_manager.py` with fixed course mappings
2. Update AI training prompts with correct prerequisite information
3. Test with original conversation examples
4. Deploy fixes to production system

### Long-term Improvements:
1. Implement knowledge base validation checks
2. Add automated testing for course information accuracy
3. Create monitoring for incorrect course information responses
4. Regular knowledge base updates from official sources

## Key Takeaways

1. **Knowledge Base is Accurate**: The core issue wasn't the KB but the routing logic
2. **Course Mapping is Critical**: Small errors in course number mapping cause major confusion
3. **Prerequisites are Complex**: Multiple prerequisites and co-requisites need careful handling
4. **Testing is Essential**: Comprehensive testing caught all the mapping issues

The fixes ensure that the AI advisor provides accurate, consistent information based on the official Purdue CS curriculum and degree progression guides.
