## 🐛 Identified Gaps & Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Regex Pattern Gaps**
   - "MI track requirements" not matching track query pattern
   - "Early graduation options" not matching graduation timeline pattern
   - "Course load for sophomores" specific phrasing issue

2. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid course code queries need better error messages
   - SQL errors should include more context for debugging

3. **Query Pattern Enhancement**
   - Could add more variations for track queries
   - Graduate school preparation queries not covered
   - Career-specific course recommendations missing

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Expand Regex Patterns**
   ```python
   # Add to track queries
   r'(?:show me |list )?(.+?) (?:track )?(?:requirements|courses|classes)'
   
   # Add to graduation queries  
   r'(?:early graduation|graduation) (?:options|choices|paths)'
   ```

2. **Enhance Error Messages**
   - Add user-friendly error messages for invalid course codes
   - Provide suggestions for similar course codes
   - Better handling of incomplete queries

3. **Add Missing Query Types**
   - Career guidance queries
   - Graduate school preparation
   - Internship/job market information
   - Course difficulty comparisons
