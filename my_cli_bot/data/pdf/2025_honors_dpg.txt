Program Progression Guides 

2025-2026 

Disclaimer: The 2025-2026 Purdue West Lafayette catalog is considered the source for academic and programmatic 
requirements for students entering programs during the Fall 2025, Spring 2026, and Summer 2026 semesters. The 
Program Progression Guide assists students in the development of an individualized 8-semester plan. Students are 
encouraged to use this guide, MyPurduePlan* (online degree auditing tool) and the Student Educational Planner (SEP) 
as they work with their academic advisor towards the completion of their degree requirements. 
Notification: Each student is ultimately responsible for knowing, monitoring and completing all degree requirements. 

An undergraduate degree in the College of Science requires completion of the following degree requirements.

Degree Electives 
Any Purdue or transfer course approved to meet degree requirements in accordance with individual departmental policies. The 
College of Science has identified courses that are below the disciplinary level of each program and major area of study. While 
similar, Not Recommended course lists vary between departments. 

* This audit is not your academic transcript and it is not official notification of completion of degree or certificate 
requirements. 

** University Core Curriculum Outcomes may be met through completion of the College of Science Core curriculum. 
Students should consult with their academic advisors and MyPurdue Plan for course selections.

Great Issues 

UC Select courses may also satisfy a University Core Curriculum requirement; see the University Core Requirement course list for 
approved courses.  Students must have 32 credits at the 30000 level or above taken at Purdue. 
* Enrollment in CS 19300: Tools is recommended with CS 17700 or CS 18000. This is not a degree requirement. CS 19700 honors 
seminar, 29100 sophomore seminar, and CS 39100 junior seminar are optional but recommended.  
Superscript of CC (eg CS 18000 CC ) indicates a Critical Course 
*** All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless of department, must be 
completed with a grade of C or better (effective Fall 2023)
