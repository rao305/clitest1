## 🔧 Fix #1: Enhanced Regex Patterns

### ✅ **Track Query Patterns Fixed**
**Before**: "Show me MI track requirements" → Failed to match  
**After**: "Show me MI track requirements" → ✅ Matches `track_courses`

**New Patterns Added:**
```regex
r'(?:show me |list )?(.+?) (?:track )?(?:requirements?|courses?|classes?)'
r'what (?:are )?(?:the )?(.+?) (?:track )?(?:requirements?|courses?)'
r'(.+?) specialization (?:courses?|requirements?)'
r'courses? (?:for |in |required for )?(.+?) specialization'
```

### ✅ **Graduation Timeline Patterns Fixed**
**Before**: "Early graduation options" → Failed to match  
**After**: "Early graduation options" → ✅ Matches `graduation_timeline`

**New Patterns Added:**
```regex
r'early graduation (?:options?|choices?|paths?)'
r'graduation (?:options?|choices?|paths?)'
r'(?:fast|quick|accelerated) graduation'
r'graduate (?:early|faster|quickly)'
```

### ✅ **Course Load Patterns Enhanced**
**Before**: "Course load for sophomores" → Pattern gap  
**After**: "Course load for sophomores" → ✅ Better matching

**Enhanced Patterns:**
```regex
r'(?:how many )?(?:courses?|credits?) (?:can|should) (?:i take )?(?:as )?(?:a )?(\w+)'
r'(?:maximum|max) (?:courses?|credits?) (?:for )?(?:a )?(\w+)'
r'course (?:limits?|maximums?) (?:by|for) (?:year|level)'
```

### ✅ **New Query Types Added**
Added support for:
- **Course Search**: "What courses are available in CS", "CS electives"
- **Course Comparison**: "Compare CS 18000 and CS 18200", "CS 25200 vs CS 25000"
- **Course Sequence**: "What comes after CS 18000", "Next course after CS 25100"

## 🤖 Fix #2: Complete AI Integration

### ✅ **SQL Success → AI Natural Language**
**Before**: Raw SQL data returned to user  
**After**: AI converts all SQL data to natural, conversational responses

```python
# AI Prompt for SQL Success
ai_prompt = f"""
The user asked: "{query}"

I found the following information from our academic database:
{json.dumps(sql_result['data'], indent=2)}

Please provide a natural, conversational response that directly answers their question using this data.
"""
```

### ✅ **SQL Errors → AI-Friendly Explanations**
**Before**: Technical database errors shown  
**After**: AI generates helpful, user-friendly guidance

```python
# AI Prompt for SQL Errors
error_prompt = f"""
The user asked: "{query}"
I encountered an issue: {user_friendly_error}

Please provide a helpful, conversational response that:
1. Acknowledges the issue naturally
2. Provides guidance on rephrasing
3. Offers alternative ways to get information
4. Maintains a supportive tone
"""
```

### ✅ **No Data Found → AI Suggestions**
**Before**: Empty results returned  
**After**: AI provides helpful suggestions and alternatives

```python
# AI Prompt for No Data
no_data_prompt = f"""
The user asked: "{query}"
I searched successfully but found no specific information.

Please provide helpful suggestions for:
1. Related questions they could ask
2. Ways to rephrase their question
3. Alternative topics that might help
"""
```

## 🛡️ Fix #3: Enhanced Error Handling

### ✅ **Context-Aware Error Messages**
Smart error detection with course-specific guidance:

```python
def _generate_user_friendly_error(self, query_type: str, param: str, error_msg: str):
    if query_type == 'course_info':
        if re.match(r'^[A-Z]{2,4}\s*\d{3,5}$', param.upper()):
            return f"I couldn't find {param.upper()}. Could you double-check the course code?"
        else:
            return f"'{param}' doesn't look like a valid course code. Try 'CS 18000' format."
```

### ✅ **Query-Type Specific Guidance**
Each query type provides relevant suggestions:
- **Course Info**: "Try asking about CS 18000, CS 25100"  
- **Prerequisites**: "Try asking 'What are the prerequisites for CS 25100?'"
- **Track Courses**: "Try asking about 'Machine Intelligence' or 'Software Engineering' tracks"

### ✅ **Graceful Exception Handling**
All technical exceptions converted to helpful AI responses:

```python
exception_prompt = f"""
The user asked: "{query}"
I encountered a technical issue but can still help.

Please provide a helpful response by:
1. Not mentioning the technical error  
2. Using your Purdue CS knowledge to answer
3. Offering to help them rephrase if needed
"""
```

## 🚫 Fix #4: Zero Hardcoded Messages

### ✅ **All User-Facing Content AI-Generated**
- ✅ No static error messages
- ✅ No template responses  
- ✅ No hardcoded course information
- ✅ No fixed conversation patterns

### ✅ **Dynamic Response Generation**
Every response is contextually generated:
1. **SQL Path**: Data → AI prompt → Natural language response
2. **Error Path**: Error context → AI prompt → Helpful guidance  
3. **JSON Path**: Query → AI conversation → Personalized response

### ✅ **Context-Aware Processing**
AI receives full context for intelligent responses:
- Original user query
- Retrieved data (if any)
- Error context (if applicable)  
- Query type and intent
- Performance metrics

## 📊 Fix #5: Additional Query Patterns

### ✅ **Course Search Enhancements**
```regex
r'what (?:courses?|classes?) (?:are available|can i take) (?:in |for )?(\w+)'
r'(?:available|offered) (\w+) (?:courses?|classes?)'
r'(\w+) (?:electives?|requirements?)'
r'(?:upper|lower) level (\w+) (?:courses?|classes?)'
```

### ✅ **Graduation Planning Enhancements**  
```regex
r'(?:can i |how to )graduate (?:in )?(?:less than |under )?(\d+) years?'
r'(?:fast|quick|accelerated) graduation'
r'graduate (?:early|faster|quickly)'
```

### ✅ **Course Load Enhancements**
```regex
r'course (?:limits?|maximums?) (?:by|for) (?:year|level)'
r'credit (?:limits?|maximums?) (?:by|for) (?:year|level)'
```
