Bot> Great question about CS 18000! Here's the complete breakdown:

Can you skip CS 18000? Yes

How to skip: placement exam during orientation

My recommendation: not recommended for most students

Why this recommendation:
• Purdue-specific programming standards and practices
• Foundation for CS 18200 problem-solving approaches
• Integration with Purdue development environment
• Teamwork and project management skills

You should consider skipping if:
• 2+ years of Java programming experience
• Strong understanding of OOP principles
• Comfortable with data structures and algorithms
• Previous coursework in computer science

You should NOT skip if:
• Self-taught programmers without formal CS background
• Students who learned non-OOP languages primarily
• Those who want to build strong fundamentals
• Students planning competitive programming or research

What's your programming background? I can give you more specific advice based on your experience![19:59:25] 🔎 Q#71 CONTEXT: None
