# ü§ó Friendly Student Advisor Integration Guide

## üéØ Problem Fixed
- ‚ùå **Before**: Robotic ChatGPT-style responses with ** formatting
- ‚úÖ **After**: Natural, encouraging student advisor conversations

## üöÄ Replit Integration Steps

### Step 1: Replace Response Generator
In your Replit project, create `friendly_response_generator.py` with the code from the artifact above.

### Step 2: Update Main System Integration
Create `integrate_friendly_advisor.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Integration script to update system with friendly advisor
"""

import sqlite3
import json
from datetime import datetime

def update_system_to_friendly():
    """Update the entire system to use friendly advisor"""
    
    print("ü§ó Converting System to Friendly Student Advisor Mode")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    # Step 1: Clear old robotic training data
    clear_robotic_responses()
    
    # Step 2: Add friendly training examples
    add_friendly_training_data()
    
    # Step 3: Update system prompts
    update_system_prompts()
    
    print("‚úÖ System successfully converted to friendly advisor mode!")

You'll take CS 25100 in fall of sophomore year, and statistics typically happens in fall of junior year. I know it's frustrating to wait, but trust me - having those prerequisites makes CS 37300 so much more manageable and enjoyable. Use sophomore year to really nail those fundamentals! The good news?

Software Engineering focuses on building robust, real-world software systems. Think about how to design apps that millions of people use, how to test code properly, and how to work effectively in teams.

Your required courses are CS 30700 (Software Engineering I) which teaches you the fundamentals, CS 38100 (Algorithms) in fall of third year, CS 40800 (Software Testing) which is super practical, CS 40700 (Senior Project) where you'll build something real, and one systems course (either CS 35200 Compilers or CS 35400 Operating Systems).

Think of those first two years as building your toolkit - you need those tools before you can start specializing! Fall of third year is when the fun really starts. You'll take CS 38100 (algorithms) which opens up all the advanced courses, plus you can start your track courses. The key thing to remember is that track courses can't start until you've got that foundation under your belt.

For example, if you use CS 47300 to satisfy your AI requirement in MI track, you can't also count it as one of your 2 electives. You'll need to pick a different course for your elective. The good news is there are plenty of interesting electives to choose from, so you won't run out of options! Don't worry, lots of students ask about this rule.",

IMPORTANT TONE GUIDELINES:
- Use natural, conversational language like you're talking to a friend
- Be encouraging and supportive - remind students "you've got this!"
- NO markdown formatting - no ** or ### or bullets with *
- Use phrases like "Great question!", "I'm happy to help!", "Don't worry"
- Acknowledge when things might feel overwhelming but stay positive
- Use "you'll" instead of "you will", contractions are fine
- Sound like a human advisor, not a chatbot

RESPONSE STYLE:
- Start with encouraging phrases: "Great question!", "I'm happy to help!"
- Use transitions: "Here's how it breaks down:", "The way it works is:"
- Add reassurance: "Don't worry, lots of students ask this", "You're on the right track!"
- End positively: "You've got this!", "Feel free to ask more questions!"
- Keep it conversational and friendly throughout

CONTENT RULES:
- Use ONLY the provided knowledge graph data
- Be accurate about course codes, prerequisites, and timing
- Explain WHY courses have certain timing (prerequisites matter)
- Give context about how courses build on each other
- Don't make up course information

EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSE:
"Great question! You'll want to take CS 38100 in the fall of your third year. I know that might seem like a while to wait, but there's a good reason for the timing.

Once you complete CS 38100, it opens up tons of advanced courses, so it's worth waiting and doing it right! Don't worry, lots of students ask about this timing."

AVOID:
- Markdown formatting (**bold**, ###headers, bullet points with *)
- Robotic language ("Please note", "It is important to understand")
- Overly formal tone
- Long lists without conversation
- ChatGPT-style responses"""

    print("‚úÖ Updated system prompts for friendly advisor mode")
    return friendly_system_prompt

if __name__ == "__main__":
    update_system_to_friendly()
```

### Step 3: Update Your Main Chat System
In your `complete_replit_deployment.py`, replace the `enhance_with_claude` function:

```python
def enhance_with_claude(self, query: str, kg_response: dict) -> dict:
    """Enhance response using Claude AI with friendly advisor prompt"""
    try:
        # Use the friendly advisor prompt

User Query: {query}

Respond in a friendly, conversational way using ONLY the knowledge graph data above. Start with encouraging phrases like "Great question!" or "I'm happy to help!" and keep it natural and supportive."""

            },
            json={

                "max_tokens": 1000,
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": claude_prompt}]
            },
            timeout=30
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            claude_data = response.json()
            enhanced_response = kg_response.copy()
            enhanced_response['response'] = claude_data['content'][0]['text']
            enhanced_response['confidence'] = 0.95
            enhanced_response['source'] = 'friendly_advisor'
            return enhanced_response

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error enhancing with Claude: {e}")
        return None
```

### Step 4: Update n8n Workflow
In your n8n workflow, update the Claude AI node with this prompt:

```javascript
const friendlyPrompt = `You are a friendly, encouraging student advisor for Purdue CS students. Help students in a conversational, supportive way.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use natural, friendly language like talking to a friend
- NO markdown formatting (no **, ###, or bullet points with *)
- Start responses with encouraging phrases: "Great question!", "I'm happy to help!"
- Use contractions and conversational tone
- Be supportive: "Don't worry", "You've got this!", "Lots of students ask this"
- Sound like a human advisor, not a chatbot

Knowledge Graph Data:
${JSON.stringify($node["Process Query via Knowledge Graph"].json.body.source_data, null, 2)}

User Query: ${$node["User Query Webhook"].json.body.query}

Respond in a friendly, conversational way using ONLY the knowledge graph data. Be encouraging and supportive!`;

return [{
  "role": "user", 
  "content": friendlyPrompt
}];
```

## üß™ Testing the Friendly System

### Step 5: Test Your Updated System
Run in Replit:

```bash
python integrate_friendly_advisor.py
python main.py
```

### Expected Results:

**Before (Robotic):**
```
**Machine Intelligence Track Requirements:**
‚Ä¢ **Required Courses (4 total):**
  - CS 37300: Data Mining and Machine Learning (MANDATORY)
  - CS 38100: Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms (MANDATORY)
‚Ä¢ **Important:** All courses must be completed with grade C or better
```

**After (Friendly):**
```
Great question! The Machine Intelligence track is really exciting - you'll get into AI, machine learning, and data science!

Here's how it breaks down: You'll need 4 required courses plus 2 electives. Don't let that number worry you - it's totally doable!

For the required courses, you need CS 37300 (Data Mining & Machine Learning) which is the heart of the track, CS 38100 (Algorithms) in fall of third year, one AI course (either CS 47100 or CS 47300), and one statistics course.

Then you get to pick 2 electives from a really nice selection. The cool thing is you have flexibility in when you take most of these. You've got this!
```

## üéØ Key Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Language Style:
- **Before**: "It is important to understand that..."
- **After**: "Here's the deal:" / "Don't worry, lots of students ask this"

### ‚úÖ Formatting:
- **Before**: `**Bold text**`, `‚Ä¢ Bullet points`
- **After**: Natural sentences, no markdown

### ‚úÖ Tone:
- **Before**: Formal, robotic, instruction-manual style
- **After**: Encouraging friend, supportive mentor

### ‚úÖ Conversation Flow:
- **Before**: Lists and structured data
- **After**: Natural explanations with context

## üöÄ Final Integration Command

Run this in your Replit console:

```bash
# Integrate friendly advisor
python integrate_friendly_advisor.py

# Test the system
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "When should I take CS 38100?", "track_context": "MI"}'
```

You should now get friendly, encouraging responses without any markdown formatting! ü§ó
