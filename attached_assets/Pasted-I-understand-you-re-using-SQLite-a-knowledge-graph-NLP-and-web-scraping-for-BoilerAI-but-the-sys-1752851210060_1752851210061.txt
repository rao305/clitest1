I understand you're using SQLite, a knowledge graph, NLP, and web scraping for BoilerAI, but the system still feels too template-based and lacks the "smartness" you’re aiming for. Since you’re focusing on Purdue’s Computer Science major and building a CLI-based chatbot, the issue likely stems from the system’s reliance on static rules or limited adaptability. Let’s diagnose why BoilerAI isn’t meeting your expectations and provide actionable steps to make it smarter, focusing on improving its recommendation logic, NLP capabilities, and knowledge graph utilization.

### Why BoilerAI Feels "Not Smart Enough"
Based on your description, here are potential reasons BoilerAI isn’t achieving the desired intelligence:
1. **Template-Based Design**: Hardcoded or overly rigid rules (e.g., “If freshman, recommend CS 180”) limit adaptability to diverse student needs.
2. **Limited NLP Understanding**: The NLP component may struggle with complex or ambiguous student queries, leading to generic or incorrect responses.
3. **Static Knowledge Graph**: The knowledge graph might not be fully leveraged for dynamic reasoning or may lack rich relationships between courses, student profiles, and goals.
4. **Basic Recommendation Logic**: Recommendations may not account for nuanced factors like workload balance, student performance, or long-term planning.
5. **Data Quality Issues**: Scraped data might be incomplete, outdated, or insufficient for personalized recommendations.
6. **Lack of Learning**: The system may not learn from user interactions or incorporate feedback to improve over time.

### Steps to Make BoilerAI Smarter

#### 1. Enhance the Knowledge Graph for Dynamic Reasoning
A knowledge graph (KG) is a powerful tool for representing relationships between courses, prerequisites, tracks, and student profiles. To make it smarter:
- **Enrich the Graph**:
  - Add nodes for:
    - Courses (e.g., CS 180, CS 381).
    - Prerequisites (e.g., CS 180 requires MATH 161).
    - Tracks (e.g., AI, Systems).
    - Student attributes (e.g., GPA, completed courses, career goals).
  - Add edges for relationships like:
    - “CS 182 requires CS 180.”
    - “CS 381 is recommended for AI track.”
    - “Student X has completed CS 180.”
  - Include weights or metadata (e.g., course difficulty, student success rates).
- **Query the Graph Dynamically**:
  - Use a graph database like Neo4j or a lightweight library like `networkx` in Python.
  - Example query: “Find all courses a student can take given their completed courses and AI track preference.”
- **Reasoning Layer**:
  - Implement pathfinding algorithms (e.g., shortest path for degree completion) to suggest optimal course sequences.
  - Example: Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path to graduation while respecting prerequisites and semester availability.

**Implementation** (using `networkx`):
```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add courses and prerequisites
G.add_nodes_from(["CS 180", "CS 182", "CS 381"], type="course")
G.add_node("AI Track", type="track")
G.add_edges_from([("CS 180", "CS 182"), ("CS 182", "CS 381")])
G.add_edge("CS 381", "AI Track", weight=0.9)  # High relevance to AI track

# Student profile
student_completed = ["CS 180"]
student_goal = "AI Track"

# Recommend courses
def recommend_courses(student_completed, goal):
    valid_courses = []
    for node in G.nodes:
        if G.nodes[node]["type"] == "course" and node not in student_completed:
            # Check if prerequisites are met
            prereqs = [pred for pred in G.predecessors(node) if G.nodes[pred]["type"] == "course"]
            if all(prereq in student_completed for prereq in prereqs):
                # Check relevance to goal
                if G.has_edge(node, goal):
                    valid_courses.append((node, G[node][goal]["weight"]))
    return sorted(valid_courses, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

recs = recommend_courses(student_completed, student_goal)
print("Recommended Courses:", [course for course, _ in recs])
# Output: Recommended Courses: ['CS 182']
```

This code models courses and tracks as a graph and recommends courses based on completed courses and career goals.

#### 2. Upgrade NLP for Better Query Understanding
Your NLP system needs to handle diverse, ambiguous, or conversational inputs (e.g., “I’m bad at math, what CS courses should I take?”). To improve:
- **Use a Stronger NLP Model**:
  - Switch to a transformer-based model like BERT or a fine-tuned version from Hugging Face (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased`).
  - Fine-tune the model on a dataset of student queries (e.g., “What’s next after CS 180?” or “I want AI courses”).
- **Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction**:
  - Train the model to recognize intents (e.g., “recommend course,” “check prerequisites”) and entities (e.g., “CS 180,” “AI track”).
  - Example: Use Rasa or Hugging Face’s `transformers` pipeline:
    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline

    nlp = pipeline("ner", model="dslim/bert-base-NER")
    query = "I finished CS 180 and want AI courses"
    entities = nlp(query)
    print(entities)
    # Extract entities like "CS 180" and "AI"
    ```
- **Dialogue Management**:
  - Use Rasa or Dialogflow to manage multi-turn conversations (e.g., “What’s your major?” → “CS” → “What courses have you taken?”).
  - Store conversation context in SQLite to maintain state (e.g., student’s year, completed courses).
- **Handle Ambiguity**:
  - Add fallback responses for unclear queries (e.g., “Can you clarify if you mean CS 180 or another course?”).
  - Use similarity matching (e.g., cosine similarity on sentence embeddings) to map vague queries to known intents.

#### 3. Improve Recommendation Logic
Move beyond template-based rules to a hybrid approach:
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**:
  - **Rule-Based**: Enforce hard constraints (e.g., prerequisites, semester availability).
  - **Content-Based**: Recommend courses based on student goals (e.g., CS 381 for AI track).
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggest courses based on what similar students took (requires historical data).
- **Incorporate Contextual Factors**:
  - **Workload Balance**: Use course difficulty scores (e.g., from scraped student reviews or professor ratings) to avoid overloading semesters.
  - **Student Performance**: Adjust recommendations based on GPA or past course grades (e.g., avoid advanced courses for students with low GPA).
  - **Long-Term Planning**: Use the knowledge graph to plan multi-semester schedules, ensuring graduation requirements are met.
- **Example Logic**:
  ```python
  def recommend_semester(student):
      max_credits = student["max_credits"]  # e.g., 15
      completed = student["completed_courses"]
      goal = student["goal"]
      
      # Query knowledge graph for valid courses
      valid_courses = recommend_courses(completed, goal)
      
      # Balance workload (simplified)
      selected = []
      total_credits = 0
      for course, relevance in valid_courses:
          course_credits = 3  # Assume 3 credits per course
          if total_credits + course_credits <= max_credits:
              selected.append(course)
              total_credits += course_credits
      return selected

  student = {"max_credits": 12, "completed_courses": ["CS 180"], "goal": "AI Track"}
  print(recommend_semester(student))
  # Output: ['CS 182']
  ```

#### 4. Leverage Scraped Data Effectively
Since you’re using web scraping, ensure the data enhances BoilerAI’s intelligence:
- **Validate Scraped Data**:
  - Clean and normalize data (e.g., handle missing prerequisites or inconsistent course codes).
  - Store in SQLite with a schema like:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE courses (
        course_id TEXT,
        name TEXT,
        credits INTEGER,
        prerequisites TEXT,
        semester TEXT,
        difficulty FLOAT,
        track TEXT
    );
    ```
- **Augment with External Sources**:
  - Scrape RateMyProfessors for course difficulty or professor quality.
  - Analyze X posts for student sentiment (e.g., “CS 250 is tough”). Use a library like `tweepy`:
    ```python
    import tweepy

    client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token="your_token")
    query = "from:PurdueCS CS 250 difficulty"
    tweets = client.search_recent_tweets(query=query, max_results=10)
    for tweet in tweets.data:
        print(tweet.text)  # Analyze for sentiment
    ```
  - Use sentiment analysis (e.g., Hugging Face’s `sentiment-analysis` pipeline) to quantify course difficulty.
- **Update Regularly**: Schedule scraping jobs (e.g., using `schedule` in Python) to keep course data current.

#### 5. Add Learning and Adaptability
To make BoilerAI truly smart, it should learn from interactions:
- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Prompt students to rate recommendations (e.g., “Was this helpful? Y/N”).
  - Store feedback in SQLite:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE feedback (
        student_id TEXT,
        recommendation TEXT,
        rating INTEGER
    );
    ```
  - Use feedback to adjust recommendation weights (e.g., prioritize courses with higher ratings).
- **Reinforcement Learning** (advanced):
  - Implement a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., using `stable-baselines3`) to optimize recommendations based on long-term outcomes (e.g., graduation success).
  - Reward function: Positive for on-time graduation, negative for course failures or overloading.
- **Personalization**:
  - Store student profiles in SQLite and update them dynamically (e.g., after completing a semester).
  - Use clustering (e.g., K-means in scikit-learn) to group students by academic patterns and tailor recommendations.

#### 6. Optimize the CLI Experience
Since you’re using a CLI, make it intuitive and conversational:
- **Interactive Prompts**:
  ```python
  def main():
      print("Welcome to BoilerAI! Let's plan your CS journey.")
      student = {
          "year": input("Your year (e.g., freshman)? "),
          "completed_courses": input("Completed courses (e.g., CS 180)? ").split(","),
          "goal": input("Career goal (e.g., AI, Systems)? ")
      }
      recs = recommend_semester(student)
      print("\nRecommended Courses:")
      for course in recs:
          print(f"- {course}")
  ```
- **Error Handling**:
  - Validate inputs (e.g., check if “CS 180” exists in the database).
  - Provide suggestions for typos (e.g., “Did you mean CS 180 instead of CS 108?”).

### Addressing the Template-Based Problem
Your current template-based design likely relies on static if-else rules. To break free:
- **Replace Rules with Queries**: Use the knowledge graph and database queries to dynamically generate recommendations.
- **Add Flexibility**: Allow the system to handle edge cases (e.g., transfer students, part-time schedules) by querying the graph for valid paths.
- **Incorporate Context**: Use NLP to extract context from queries (e.g., “I’m struggling with math” → avoid math-heavy courses like CS 314).

### Example of a Smarter BoilerAI
Here’s how a smarter interaction might look:
```
Welcome to BoilerAI!
Your year? sophomore
Completed courses? CS 180
Career goal? AI
Recommended for Fall 2025:
- CS 182: Foundations of CS (3 credits, prerequisite met)
- CS 240: Programming in C (3 credits, prerequisite met)
- MA 261: Calculus II (4 credits, general ed)
Total: 10 credits
Note: CS 182 is key for the AI track. Avoid CS 251 this semester to balance workload.
```

This output comes from:
- Knowledge graph checking prerequisites and track relevance.
- NLP parsing the query to extract “sophomore,” “CS 180,” and “AI.”
- Recommendation logic balancing credits and difficulty.

### Next Steps
1. **Refine the Knowledge Graph**:
   - Add more relationships (e.g., course difficulty, professor ratings).
   - Test queries using `networkx` or Neo4j.
2. **Upgrade NLP**:
   - Fine-tune a BERT model on sample queries (start with 50–100 examples).
   - Integrate with the CLI using Hugging Face or Rasa.
3. **Enhance Recommendations**:
   - Add workload balancing and long-term planning.
   - Incorporate scraped data (e.g., course difficulty from X posts).
4. **Test with Users**:
   - Share the CLI with Purdue CS students (e.g., via Discord or X) and collect feedback.
   - Iterate based on user complaints (e.g., “Recommendations feel generic”).
5. **Plan for Scalability**:
   - Once the CLI works, consider a web app (e.g., Flask) for broader access.
