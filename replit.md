# BoilerAI CLI Chat Engine

## Overview

This is a sophisticated CLI chatbot application built with Python that provides specialized academic advising for Purdue University Computer Science students. The **Enhanced Boiler AI CLI Chat** system integrates all advanced features into a single, comprehensive academic advisor.

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with real Purdue CS data, vector embeddings, and semantic search capabilities to provide accurate academic guidance with verified prerequisite information from official flowcharts.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The Enhanced Boiler AI CLI Chat features a unified architecture:

### Core Components
- **Enhanced CLI Interface**: Integrated academic advisor with knowledge retrieval
- **RAG Engine Layer**: Vector search and context retrieval with real curriculum data
- **Data Pipeline Layer**: Web scraping, PDF processing, and text normalization
- **Vector Store Layer**: FAISS-based semantic search with OpenAI embeddings
- **Knowledge Graph**: Prerequisite chain validation and course sequencing
- **Prerequisite Intelligence**: Official flowchart-based prerequisite validation

The architecture provides sophisticated knowledge-augmented responses with verified academic information.

## Key Components

### Basic Implementation

### 1. Chat Interface (`chat.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main CLI application entry point
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - User input/output handling
  - Conversation loop management
  - History maintenance
  - Exit command processing
- **Design Decision**: Uses a simple while loop for continuous interaction rather than complex event handling

### 2. LLM Engine (`llm_engine.py`)
- **Purpose**: OpenAI API integration and response generation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - API key management
  - System prompt loading
  - Message history processing
  - Response generation
  - Memory management through history summarization
- **Design Decision**: Uses OpenAI's official Python client for reliability and maintained API compatibility

### Enhanced Boiler AI Implementation

### 3. Enhanced Chat Interface (`chat.py`)
- **Purpose**: Integrated academic advisor CLI interface with knowledge retrieval
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Academic-focused conversation flow with RAG integration
  - Vector search and context retrieval
  - Help system with CS-specific guidance
  - Verification badges for knowledge-based responses
- **Design Decision**: Unified system combining conversational AI with domain-specific knowledge retrieval

### 5. Data Pipeline Components
- **Web Scraper (`scrape_html.py`)**: Extracts course data from Purdue CS websites
- **PDF Processor (`scrape_pdfs.py`)**: Downloads and extracts text from degree guides
- **Text Normalizer (`normalize.py`)**: Chunks and cleans text data for embedding
- **Vector Builder (`build_vector.py`)**: Creates FAISS index with OpenAI embeddings
- **Setup Script (`setup_roo.py`)**: Orchestrates complete data processing pipeline

### 6. Enhanced System Prompt (`prompts/system.txt`)
- **Purpose**: Defines specialized academic advisor behavior
- **Key Features**:
  - Purdue CS-specific scope enforcement
  - Academic formatting standards
  - Policy-driven response handling
  - RAG integration instructions

### 7. Test Suite (`tests/test_engine.py` + `test_roo.py`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing for both implementations
- **Coverage**: Basic engine testing, RAG functionality, and academic advisor responses
- **Design Decision**: Separate test files for different complexity levels

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User types message in terminal
2. **History Management**: Message added to in-memory conversation history
3. **API Call**: History sent to OpenAI API with system prompt
4. **Response Processing**: Bot response formatted and displayed
5. **Memory Management**: History automatically summarized when exceeding 20 messages

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **OpenAI Python Client (>=1.0.0)**: Official OpenAI API client for chat completions
- **pytest (>=7.0.0)**: Testing framework for unit tests

### Environment Variables
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Required for API authentication

### Design Rationale
- Minimal dependencies reduce complexity and potential conflicts
- Official OpenAI client ensures API compatibility and security
- No database dependencies keep the system stateless and portable

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Direct Python execution with `python3 chat.py`
- Virtual environment recommended for dependency isolation
- Environment variable configuration for API keys

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Stateless Design**: No persistent storage or database dependencies
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment and reduces infrastructure requirements
   - **Trade-off**: Conversation history lost between sessions

2. **In-Memory History Management**: Automatic summarization when history exceeds 20 messages
   - **Rationale**: Prevents token limit issues and maintains conversation context
   - **Implementation**: Oldest messages summarized to 2-3 sentence bullet points

3. **Terminal-Only Interface**: No GUI or web interface
   - **Rationale**: Focuses on core conversational functionality
   - **Benefit**: Lightweight and universally accessible

4. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between CLI, engine, and configuration
   - **Rationale**: Enables easy testing and future extensions
   - **Benefit**: Components can be modified independently

5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and missing configurations
   - **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with informative error messages
   - **User Experience**: Clear feedback for configuration issues

The system is designed to be a clean, focused implementation that can serve as a foundation for more complex chatbot applications while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
